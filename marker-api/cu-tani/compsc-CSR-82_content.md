# CMSM- Theory: Problem Solving using C DSC/CC-2, Theory, Semester - 2, Credits - 03, Contact hours - 45.

## Objective Of The Course

The objectives of this course are to make the student understand programming language, programming, concepts of Loops, reading a set of Data, stepwise refinement, Functions, Control structure, Arrays. After completion of this course the student is expected to analyze the real life problem and write a program in 'C' language to solve the problem. The main emphasis of the course will be on problem solving aspect i.e. developing proper algorithms. After completion of the course the student will be able to; 1. Develop efficient algorithms for solving a problem. 2. Use the various constructs of a programming language viz. conditional, iteration and recursion.

3. Implement the algorithms in "C" language. 4. Use simple data structures like arrays, stacks and linked list in solving problems. 5. Handling File in "C".
