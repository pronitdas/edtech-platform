# [Epic] Modernize UI Component Architecture

## Background
Based on issue #009-ui-component-library-modernization.md, we need to create a more consistent, accessible, and maintainable component structure.

## Technical Details

### Components to Update
- `MainCourse`: Refactor into smaller, more focused components
- `VideoPlayer`: Modernize with current best practices
- `MarkdownSlideshow`: Improve reusability and configuration options
- All interactive components: Enhance accessibility

### Tasks
1. Break down large components into smaller, reusable pieces
2. Implement consistent prop interfaces across components
3. Add proper accessibility attributes to all interactive elements
4. Modernize component architecture with current React patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- Components follow a consistent architectural pattern
- All interactive elements are properly accessible
- Component responsibilities are clearly defined and focused
- Improved code reuse across the application
