# TypeScript Type Safety Implementation - Remaining Tasks

## Background
We have started implementing type safety across components based on the Supabase schema. This document lists remaining tasks and issues to be addressed.

## Files Updated
- ✅ Created `/src/types/database.ts` - Contains proper type definitions for database tables
- ✅ Updated `/src/utils/contentHelpers.ts` - Added proper typing for helper functions
- ✅ Updated `/src/api/knowledge.ts` - Added return types and used proper interfaces
- ✅ Updated `/src/hooks/useChapters.ts` - Added proper type definitions for state and functions
- ✅ Updated `/src/components/MainCourse.tsx` - Started updating component props with proper types

## Remaining Issues

### MainCourse.tsx
1. Component uses quiz data that doesn't match the defined QuizQuestion type
2. Special handling needed for roleplay data format
3. Several type mismatches when rendering different content types
4. Need to refactor type handling in ContentToggle and other sub-components

### useChapters.ts
1. Return type definition needs to be added to the hook
2. Ensure proper typing of data coming from supabase queries

### contentHelpers.ts
1. Ensure proper handling of parse errors when converting JSON strings

### Quiz.tsx
1. Ensure Question interface matches QuizQuestion from the database types

## Implementation Plan
1. Complete MainCourse.tsx type safety updates
2. Ensure quiz data is properly typed and mapped between components
3. Update all component props to use proper interfaces
4. Remove any remaining `any` types or explicit type assertions
5. Ensure all functions have proper return types

## Testing Strategy
1. Ensure no TypeScript compiler errors
2. Test with both valid and invalid data to ensure type safety at runtime
3. Verify that refactored components behave identically to the original implementation 

# UI Component Modernization Plan

Based on `epics/ep-005-component-modernization.md`, this document outlines the detailed modernization plan for the specified components.

## Component Refactoring Strategy

### 1. MainCourse Component

**Current Issues:**
- Large component (690 lines) with too many responsibilities
- Handles UI state, content loading, and rendering of various content types
- Complex state management with multiple interconnected states

**Modernization Plan:**
1. ✅ Split into smaller, focused components:
   - `CourseHeader`: Navigation and course title (Implemented ✅)
   - `CourseContent`: Main content area container (Implemented ✅)
   - `CourseSidebar`: Navigation and content selection (To be implemented)
   - `CourseSettings`: Settings panel (Implemented as `ContentGenerationPanel` ✅)
   - `CourseContentRenderer`: Conditionally renders the appropriate content component (Implemented ✅)

2. ✅ Create custom hooks:
   - `useCourseState`: Manage course UI state (Implemented ✅)
   - `useContentGeneration`: Handle content generation logic (Partially handled by `useCourseState` and `useChapters` ✅)

3. 🚧 Improve accessibility:
   - Add proper ARIA roles and labels (Partially done in `CourseHeader` 🚧)
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works (Partially done in `CourseHeader` 🚧)

**Current State (Post-Refactoring):**
- `CourseMain` (`src/components/course/CourseMain.tsx`) now acts as the main container, using `CourseProvider` to manage state via the `useCourseState` hook.
- `CourseHeader` (`src/components/course/CourseHeader.tsx`) handles top navigation, chapter title, back button, settings button, and the **new report button**. Tab navigation is also included here.
- `CourseContent` (`src/components/course/CourseMain.tsx`) receives props and renders the `CourseHeader`, `ContentGenerationPanel` (settings), `CourseContentRenderer`, and the `LearningReport` modal.
- `CourseContentRenderer` (`src/components/course/CourseContentRenderer.tsx`) is responsible for rendering the specific content based on the `activeTab`.
- `useCourseState` hook (`src/hooks/useCourseState.ts`) centralizes state management for the course view (active tab, sidebar state, report visibility, settings visibility, etc.).
- **Report Functionality:** The "Report" tab has been removed. A button in the `CourseHeader` now triggers the display of the `LearningReport` modal via the `handleShowReport` function in `useCourseState`.

**Remaining Linter Issues:**
- ✅ `CourseMain.tsx`: Persistent linter error regarding `onGenerateContent` prop passed to `CourseContentRenderer`. Type definition might be incorrect in `CourseContentRendererProps` or the linter is providing faulty feedback. (Investigated `CourseContentRenderer.tsx` props definition) - RESOLVED

**Next Steps:**
1. ~~Investigate and fix the remaining linter error regarding `CourseContentRendererProps` in `CourseContentRenderer.tsx`.~~ ✅ RESOLVED
2. Implement the `CourseSidebar` component for chapter navigation (if needed based on design). - DEFERRED
3. Complete accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) across all new `Course*` components. - DEFERRED
4. Add unit tests for the new components (`CourseMain`, `CourseHeader`, `CourseContent`, `CourseContentRenderer`, `useCourseState`).
5. Verify the behavior of the report button and modal.

**Implementation Details:**
1. ✅ Component Structure:
   - Create a component directory: `src/components/course/`
   - Implement each component with its own file and types
   - Use forward refs where appropriate for DOM access

2. ✅ State Management:
   - Implement `useCourseState` hook to centralize state
   - Use React Context to avoid prop drilling
   - Separate UI state from data state

3. 🚧 Accessibility Implementation:
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Implement focus management system
   - Add keyboard shortcuts with proper documentation

4. 🚧 Testing Strategy:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Accessibility tests using jest-axe

### 2. VideoPlayer Component ✅

**Current Issues:**
- Large component (510 lines) with tightly coupled functionality
- Manages too many UI concerns (controls, markers, timeline, etc.)
- Has accessibility limitations

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETED ✅

**Modernization Implemented:**
1. Split into smaller components:
   - `VideoCore`: Core video functionality ✅
   - `VideoControls`: Play/pause, volume, fullscreen controls ✅
   - `VideoTimeline`: Timeline with markers ✅
   - `VideoMarker`: Individual marker component ✅
   - `VideoTooltip`: Tooltip for markers ✅

2. Created custom hooks:
   - `useVideoState`: Manage video playback state ✅

3. Improved accessibility:
   - Added proper keyboard controls ✅
   - Included ARIA labels and roles ✅
   - Added screen reader support ✅

4. New components are available in `src/components/video/` directory ✅

### 3. MarkdownSlideshow Component ✅

**Current Issues:**
- Limited configuration options
- Poor reusability across different contexts
- Basic accessibility

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETED ✅

**Modernization Implemented:**
1. Enhanced component API:
   - Added theming support (light/dark/system modes) ✅
   - Created more flexible navigation options ✅
   - Added support for additional styling options ✅

2. Improved accessibility:
   - Added keyboard navigation ✅
   - Included proper ARIA attributes ✅
   - Added screen reader support ✅

3. Created supporting components:
   - `SlideshowControls`: Navigation controls ✅

4. New components are available in `src/components/slideshow/` directory ✅

## Implementation Approach

1. Create a component library structure in `src/components/ui` ✅
2. Implement base UI components first ✅
3. Build specialized components on top of base components ✅
4. Update existing components to use the new component architecture ✅
5. Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
6. Document component API and usage patterns

## Accessibility Standards

All components will follow these accessibility guidelines:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ✅
- Proper focus management ✅
- Keyboard navigation support ✅
- Screen reader friendly ✅
- Appropriate color contrast ✅

## Next Steps

1. Implement MainCourse refactoring following the established patterns:
   - Apply the same component breakdown strategy used for VideoPlayer
   - Utilize custom hooks for state isolation
   - Implement proper accessibility patterns
   - Focus on clean interfaces and type safety

2. Add unit tests for all components
3. Create documentation for component usage
4. Migrate existing implementations to use new components

## Migration Plan

For the next development cycle, we should:

1.  **Integrate Modernized Components:**
    *   Replace usages of the old `VideoPlayer` with the modernized version from `src/components/video/`.
    *   Replace usages of the old `MarkdownSlideshow` with the modernized version from `src/components/slideshow/`.
    *   Update `src/components/course/CourseMain.tsx` and related components (e.g., `CourseContentRenderer.tsx`) to correctly integrate and pass props to the modernized player and slideshow components.

2.  **Complete `MainCourse` Refactoring:**
    *   ~~Investigate and resolve the linter error concerning `CourseContentRendererProps` in `src/components/course/CourseContentRenderer.tsx`.~~ ✅ RESOLVED
    *   Implement the `CourseSidebar` component (`src/components/course/CourseSidebar.tsx`) if required by the design specifications. - DEFERRED
    *   Ensure all components within `src/components/course/` meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA, ARIA roles/labels, keyboard navigation, focus management). Address partial implementations noted in `CourseHeader`. - DEFERRED

3.  **Finalize TypeScript Type Safety:**
    *   Complete the type safety implementation in `MainCourse.tsx` and its related components/hooks (`useCourseState`, `useChapters`). Address issues like quiz data typing and special handling for different content types.
    *   Verify `Quiz.tsx` uses the correct `QuizQuestion` type from `src/types/database.ts`.
    *   Eliminate remaining `any` types and unnecessary type assertions across the refactored codebase.
    *   Ensure all functions have explicit return types defined.
    *   Ensure proper error handling for JSON parsing in `contentHelpers.ts`.

4.  **Implement Testing Strategy:**
    *   Add unit tests (e.g., Jest/React Testing Library) for all new and refactored components (`CourseMain`, `CourseHeader`, `CourseContent`, `CourseContentRenderer`, `CourseSidebar` if implemented, `useCourseState`, modernized `VideoPlayer` components, modernized `MarkdownSlideshow` components).
    *   Write integration tests to verify interactions within the `CourseMain` component structure.
    *   Implement accessibility tests (e.g., using `jest-axe`) for all relevant components.

5.  **Documentation and Verification:**
    *   Create documentation outlining the API and usage patterns for the modernized `VideoPlayer`, `MarkdownSlideshow`, and `Course` components.
    *   Perform a final check for any remaining TypeScript compiler errors.
    *   Conduct thorough manual testing, including edge cases and different data inputs, to ensure runtime type safety and functional correctness.
    *   Verify the behavior of the report button and modal functionality in `CourseHeader` and `useCourseState`.
