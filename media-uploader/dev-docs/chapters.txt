LTD., PUNE  \n1  Brief Introduction  \nOur BDW Laser Diameter Gauges are specialized instruments for non-contact dynamic measuring which \ncan not only measure and display the diameter and deviation online for round objects like fiber and optical \ncables, electrical wires and cables, glass and plastic tubes and bearings, but also can automatically control the \ndiameter and print relevant parameters according to user\u2019s demand.  \n\uf06c \nSuitable for online measurement of any round wires and other objects;  \n\uf06c \nNon-contact measurement, high-speed inspection, high precision and stable performance;  \n\uf06c \nAdopt F\u03b8 optical lens with small influence caused by wire jittering;  \n\uf06c \nIn-built PID regulation module to control wire diameter automatically;  \n\uf06c \nAll-directional revolving operation panel; Optional remote display with various sizes;  \n\uf06c \nWith multi address RS232/485 communication interface;  \n\uf06c \nOptional quality software which can record the changing curve of measuring outside diameter;  \n\uf06c \nAdopt long lifetime semi-conduct laser and high reliable brushless motor, which can adapt to continuous \nwork in harsh environment.  \nOur BDW dual axis laser diameter gauges are compact in structure. It consists of a gauge, an operation panel \nand a remote controller. Meanwhile, optional remote displays in various sizes is available. (Figure 1-1).  \nFigure 1-1 (Dual Axis)  \nOur laser diameter gauge has the inbuilt high precision laser scanning system and embedded digital processing \ncircuit. The signal of diameter generated by scanning system is converted to digital signal firstly. Then real \n                                                                       Page 4/45                BDW INSTRUMENTS PVT. LTD., PUNE  \ndiameter and relevant data is obtained through a series of calculation and processing. The device output contains \none RS485 interface and two interfaces for connecting remote display. Through the RS485 interface, it could \ntransfer measured data to peripheral devices (e.g. remote controller, Upper PC and PLC, etc.). Through the \nremote display interface, it can connect with various sizes of remote display to realize remote displaying.   \nOperation panel installed on the top of the instrument can display three channels of data. Its viewing angle \ncan be adjusted easily.  \nThe Remote controller is mainly used for the purpose of automatic control. It obtains measured diameter \ndata from the instrument through RS485 interface. This data will be compared with the standard diameter value \nset by the user and then generate PID adjustment signal to control the rotation speed of the tractor in order to \ncontrol the wire diameter. In addition, the remote controller has full functional operation panel, standard \ncommunication interface and can also communicate with upper PC, PLC and other equipment. It can also \nsupport quality management software. \n                                                        Page 5/45               BDW INSTRUMENTS PVT.
