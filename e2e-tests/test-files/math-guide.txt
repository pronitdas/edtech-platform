# Mathematics Learning Guide

## Chapter 1: Basic Algebra
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.

### Key Concepts:
- Variables: Letters that represent unknown numbers
- Coefficients: Numbers that multiply variables
- Constants: Numbers that don't change

### Example Problems:
1. Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15
   Solution: x = 5

2. Simplify: 3x + 2x - 4
   Solution: 5x - 4

## Chapter 2: Linear Equations
Linear equations are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1.

### Practice Problems:
- 4x - 8 = 12 (Answer: x = 5)
- -2x + 6 = 0 (Answer: x = 3)
- 7x + 14 = 35 (Answer: x = 3)
