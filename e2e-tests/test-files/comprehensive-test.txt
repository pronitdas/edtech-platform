# Mathematics Learning Guide

## Chapter 1: Basic Algebra

Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.

### Key Concepts:
- Variables: Letters that represent unknown numbers
- Coefficients: Numbers that multiply variables
- Constants: Numbers that don't change
- Expressions: Mathematical phrases with variables and numbers
- Equations: Mathematical statements that show equality

### Example Problems:
1. Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15
   Solution: x = 5

2. Simplify: 3x + 2x - 4
   Solution: 5x - 4

## Chapter 2: Linear Equations

Linear equations are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1.

### Standard Form: ax + b = c

### Steps to Solve:
1. Isolate the variable term
2. Divide by the coefficient
3. Check your answer

### Practice Problems:
- 4x - 8 = 12 (Answer: x = 5)
- -2x + 6 = 0 (Answer: x = 3)
- 7x + 14 = 35 (Answer: x = 3)

## Chapter 3: Slope and Linear Functions

The slope of a line measures how steep it is.

### Slope Formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

### Types of Slopes:
- Positive slope: line goes up from left to right
- Negative slope: line goes down from left to right
- Zero slope: horizontal line
- Undefined slope: vertical line
